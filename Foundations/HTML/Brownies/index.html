            <p>
                For years, I couldn’t seem to find a recipe for brownies that
                met my standards. Anytime I made homemade brownies, I wanted
                them to be just like the ones I ate as a kid – super fudgy,
                moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops. But
                the thing is, these brownies didn’t come from a recipe. We
                always made them from a box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from
                scratch, but no brownie recipe I tried could live up to the
                chocolate brownies of my childhood.
            </p>

            <p>
                So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle Lopez’s new book
                Weeknight Baking, her recipe for Boxed Mix Brownies, From
                Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able to make homemade
                brownies that would be just as delicious as the ones from a box?
            </p>

            <p>
                The verdict: yes! I’ve had this brownie recipe on repeat since
                the first time I tried it. It calls for basic pantry
                ingredients, and it’s hardly more difficult than using a mix. As
                for the brownies, they’re true perfection – glossy, fudgy, and
                filled with rich chocolate flavor. Trust me, you’re going to
                want to make them ASAP!
            </p>

            <p>
                Another thing you should do ASAP is check out Weeknight Baking!
                This book is packed with crave-worthy recipes that are meant for
                busy weeknights. Each one comes with fun variations (I have my
                eye on the matcha snickerdoodles) as well as tips for becoming a
                more efficient baker. After years of juggling a 9-to-5 job and
                running her blog, Hummingbird High, Michelle is full of wisdom
                on how to bake on a busy schedule. She writes, “We’re all doing
                the best we can with what we have. And I’m going to help you
                bake any night of the week that works for you.” If you love
                baking, you’ll love this book.

                <p>
                    Back to Michelle’s recipe for brownies! In order for it to
                    turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, Michelle uses
                    granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate
                    chips. Then, she adds these key ingredients:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>2 eggs + water</strong> – Michelle uses a bit of
                        water with the eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture
                        of boxed mix brownies without any commercial
                        emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn’t contain any
                        baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the
                        brownies puff up in the oven.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Powdered sugar</strong> – The trick to making
                        homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box!
                        Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken
                        the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in
                        a mix.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Unsweetened cocoa powder</strong> – Michelle
                        recommends using Hershey’s Special Dark Dutch-processed
                        cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder).
                        Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Oil </strong> - While many recipes for brownies
                        use unsalted butter, Michelle’s calls for canola oil,
                        just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil because it’s
                        what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
                        really amps up the chocolate flavor.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>That’s it! These fantastic homemade brownies are so easy.</p>

                <h4>How to Make Brownies from Scratch</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two
                        separate bowls.</strong
                    >
                    Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder,
                    chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk
                    together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.
                </p>
                <img src="step1.jpg" />
                <p>
                    <strong>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients.</strong>
                    Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until
                    just combined. The batter will be thick!
                </p>
                <img src="step2.jpg" />
                <p>
                    <strong
                        >Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined
                        with parchment paper.
                    </strong>
                    Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the
                    pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick –
                    that’s ok.
                </p>
                <img src="step3.jpg" />
                <p>
                    <strong>Finally, bake!</strong> Transfer the pan to a
                    325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a
                    toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached.
                    Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and
                    serving. Enjoy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room
                    temperature for up to 3 days. They also freeze well for up
                    to a month. Last time I made these, I doubled the recipe and
                    stored the second batch in the freezer. It was so fun to
                    have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon
                    treat!

                        >
                        In her book, Michelle writes that one of the biggest
                        secrets to making great brownies is using large,
                        good-quality chocolate chips. She recommends
                        Ghiradelli’s 60% Cacao Bittersweet Baking Chips, while I
                        love Enjoy Life’s Dark Chocolate Morsels. Either brand
                        would fantastic in this recipe!

                    <li>
                        <strong
                            >It’s better to pull them out too early than to
                            leave them in too long. </strong
                        >No one likes dry brownies, so err on the side of
                        caution when you’re making this recipe. Bake them until
                        a toothpick inserted comes out with just a few crumbs
                        attached. If you’re on the fence, go ahead and take them
                        out of the oven. They’ll continue to firm up as they
                        cool!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wait for them to cool. </strong>Try your best to
                        resist eating these guys straight out of the oven.
                        Letting them cool makes them gooier and fudgier, and
                        they’ll be less likely to crumble when you slice them.
                        Plus, they’ll have an even richer chocolate flavor.
                        Trust me, it’s worth the wait!
